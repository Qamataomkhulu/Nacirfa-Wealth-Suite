## 🧩 Step 4 — First Feature to Build

Let’s start with a simple, working **Crypto Data Fetcher** using `ccxt` inside `datahub/fetch_crypto_data.py`:

It’ll:
- Pull BTC, ETH, SOL prices from Binance
- Save them to CSV
- Print summary (like avg price, change %)

Would you like me to generate that **Python script** as the **first real code file** for your repo?  
(We can then move to FX or JSE data fetch next.)
